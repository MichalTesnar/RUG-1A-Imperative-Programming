2. *Removing Values*
Even though the function as a whole is increasing, we can still skip
skip a number, because that may lead to better overall result later.

3. *Constrained Bitstrings*
If you have already placed a digit and it does not work, the program
must be able to backtrack to by last position and remove the digit.

4. *Talking Knights*
Switch of x and y coordinates passed into the matrix
-> X is horizontal, Y is vertical

To generate knight movements, we can loop from -2 to 2 on both
coordinates, but they cannot be the same and neither can be equal
to zero.

If we want the whole function to return boolean value, we can use
the value of the whole function as a conditition in itself, which
then propagates to the previous return.
